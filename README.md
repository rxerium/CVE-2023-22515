# CVE-2023-22515


 ## How does this detection method work?

 This template looks at the following endpoints:
 ```
      - "{{BaseURL}}/dologin.action"
      - "{{BaseURL}}"
      - "{{BaseURL}}/pages"
      - "{{BaseURL}}/confluence"
      - "{{BaseURL}}/wiki"
 ```

 From these endpoints it will extract the version, if the version matches any of the below versions it is considered vulnerable:

 ```
          - "8.0.0"
          - "8.0.1"
          - "8.0.2"
          - "8.0.3"
          - "8.0.4"
          - "8.1.0"
          - "8.1.1"
          - "8.1.3"
          - "8.1.4"
          - "8.2.0"
          - "8.2.1"
          - "8.2.2"
          - "8.2.3"
          - "8.3.0"
          - "8.3.1"
          - "8.3.2"
          - "8.4.0"
          - "8.4.1"
